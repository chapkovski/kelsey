        As stated in the instructions, your final payoff includes your show up fee ({{ part_fee_in_points }}) plus your
        earned points
        from two randomly selected rounds: one from Part 1 and one from Part 2. The points of these two rounds and the
        show up fee were added together and then converted to dollars at a rate of {{ show_rate }} per point. In
        addition, you
        earned some additional points from the compensated survey questions. These points will be converted to dollars
        using the same rate.
