                <p>Welcome and thank you for participating in this experiment.</p>

                <p>You will be paid in this experiment in the following two ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You will be paid {{ part_fee_in_points }} of show up fee.</li>
                    <li>
                        Each point is worth {{ show_rate }} so you will start with an initial wallet of $31.00. Based on your
                        decisions, you will win and lose money. At a minimum you finish with $7.
                    </li>

                    <li>You will earn money based on your choices.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Please turn off your cellphone and put away your electronic devices.</p>
                <p>The entire experiment will take place through the computer terminals. Please do not communicate with
                    other participants in the study.</p>

                <p>When you are finished with the page of instructions, please press the "Next" button in the bottom of
                    the screen.</p>
                <p>Pressing this button will take you the the next set of instructions, and you will not be able to
                    return to the previous screen.</p>
                <p>Click "Next" to go to the next screen. You will need to do this to advance once you are done with
                    each screen.</p>
