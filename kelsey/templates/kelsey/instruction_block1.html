<p>In Part {% if view.round_number == 1 %}1{% else %}2{% endif %},
    each round gives you a choice over an investment contract
    with the following elements. The values associated with
    these elements will change from round to round.
</p>
<ul class="list-group striped">
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info">
        An initial investment cost.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning ">
        Two possible payoffs (which one you actually get will be randomly determined).
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">
        The chances associated with each possible payoff.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">
        A final investment cost.
    </li>
</ul>


<p>After learning these elements:</p>

    {% if player.treatment == 'T2' %}
        <li>You will choose at the start whether or not to pay <b>both</b>, the <span class="info">initial investment cost</span>
