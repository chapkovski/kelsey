<p>In Part {% if player.treatment == 'T0' %}1{% else %}2{% endif %},
    each round gives you a choice over an investment contract
    with the following elements. The values associated with
    these elements will change from round to round.
</p>
<ul class="list-group striped">
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info">
        An initial investment cost.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning ">
        Two possible payoffs (which one you actually get will be randomly determined).
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">
        The chances associated with each possible payoff.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">
        A final investment cost.
    </li>
</ul>


<p>After learning these elements:</p>

<ul>
    {% if player.treatment == 'T2' %}
        <li>You will choose at the start whether or not to pay <b>both</b>, the <span class="info">initial investment cost</span>
            and the <span class="success">final
            cost</span>.
        </li>
    {% else %}
        <li>You will choose whether or not to pay the <span class="info">initial investment cost</span>.</li>
    {% endif %}


    <li>If you choose the pay the <span class="info">cost</span>, a random number generator will determine
        the exact <span class="warning">payoff</span> according to the stated <span class="danger">chances</span>.
    </li>


    {% if player.treatment == 'T0' %}
        <li>If the <span class="warning">payoff</span> is greater than the <span

            then the <span class="success">final investment cost</span> will be automatically charged
            and you will earn the <span class="warning">payoff</span>. This is the amount that will be added to your
            show up fee and earnings in the other part of the experiment:

        <li>You will choose whether or not to pay the <span class="success">final investment cost</span>
            in order to release the <span class="warning">payoff</span>. Notice that, unlike in the last Part, you now
            have to make a decision about whether to pay the final investment cost, which will happen after you learn
            the payoffs.
